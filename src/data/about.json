    "overview": "Jamiat-ul-Ulama Isna Asharia, Kargil-Ladakh is the largest Islamic organization in Ladakh and the oldest body of religious leaders in the region. It caters primarily to the socio-religious needs of the local Shia Muslim community by overseeing religious guidance, running madrasas, and monitoring prayer practices. The institution also organizes Friday prayers in Kargil town and plays a vital role in the cultural and educational development of the area.",
    "history": "Established in 1953, the institution was founded to address the religious and educational needs of the predominantly Shia population in Ladakh. Over the decades, it has grown to assume jurisdiction over local Ulemas, deputing them to villages for religious guidance and community service. Recent elections were held on 11 September 2021, resulting in the re-election of Sheikh Nazir Mehdi Mohammadi as president for the second term."
